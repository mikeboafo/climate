                Every year, the Old Girls of Wesley Girls’ High School (WGHS) give back to their Alma Mater and the Kakumdo community. In 2026, the Class of 2004 will continue this legacy by supporting the school’s growth.
            
             
                Please join us, through your donation(s) in honouring our Alma Mater and making a lasting difference as we complete and furnish the first floor of our Resource Centre — ‘The Legacy Project’.
